# Changelog

## 2.7.0

- Add `fromcacheifyounger` URL parameter: serve a previously rendered
  screenshot instantly when it is younger than the given number of seconds, or
  use `fromcacheifyounger=always` to serve any prior render regardless of age
- Cache matches on the exact screenshot parameters; requests without the
  parameter always render fresh
- Combining `next` with `fromcacheifyounger` gives a self-refreshing cache: the
  pre-warm renders a fresh screenshot and replaces the cached entry, and every
  cached serve re-arms the next pre-warm, so polling clients always get an
  instant image that is at most one `next` interval old. The pre-warm forces a
  full page reload so dashboards that do not live-update are still captured
  fresh; `next` without `fromcacheifyounger` keeps its previous cheap
  navigate-only warm-up
- Split request handling out of `http.js` into `request-handler.js` so it can
  be tested (`node --test test_request_handler.mjs`)

## 2.6.0

- Fix corrupted 24-bit BMP output for viewport widths not divisible by 4
- Fix crash generating 1-bit BMP output for viewport widths not divisible by 8
- Fix scheduled `next` preloads rendering at an increasingly wrong viewport height
- Fix repeated requests being slow after an invalid-authentication error (state is now reset so the next request does a full page load)
- The deprecated `eink` parameter now returns a 400 error for values other than 2 instead of silently returning a full-color screenshot (`eink=2` is still converted to `colors=000000,FFFFFF`)
- Validate viewport dimensions (10-4000 px) and zoom (max 10) to prevent a single request from exhausting memory
- Skip image re-encoding for plain PNG screenshots without rotate/invert/colors, speeding up the most common request
- Speed up dithering with a palette lookup cache
- The web UI no longer loads Tailwind from a CDN and now works without internet access
- Return a 500 response instead of leaving the client hanging when a screenshot fails unexpectedly
- Mask the access token in the add-on configuration UI
- Run the container with Docker's default init so defunct Chromium processes are reaped

## 2.5.0
